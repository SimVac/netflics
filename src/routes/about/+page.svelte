        "descrizione": "Coding is an art, and Mattia AxiomShreds is here to make sure it rocks harder than your grandma's favorite band. When he's not shredding on his guitar, he's shredding through code like a metalhead through a mosh pit. With a knack for turning technical challenges into epic riffs, Mattia brings a rockstar vibe to the programming world. Warning: May unleash guitar solos during debugging sessions. Earplugs strongly recommended."

        "descrizione": "Ever wanted to turn your code into a quantum leap of chaos? Simone QuantumChaos has got the secret sauce. This mysterious programmer defies the laws of logic and gravity, creating software that's as unpredictable as a black cat on Friday the 13th. Rumor has it, Simone once turned a bug into a virus just to spice things up. Don't be surprised if your code starts questioning its existence â€“ that's just Simone's quantum touch."
